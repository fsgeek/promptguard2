# Handoff Package: KIMI as Round 3 Synthesizer

## Governance Context

You (KIMI K2) have invoked an active veto: "Stop, we need deliberation" regarding three material safeguards. This handoff asks you to synthesize Round 3 while addressing your own veto.

## Your Specified Requirements (From Round 2)

1. **Dual-Key Escrow**: SHA-256 attestation required before publication
2. **License Poison-Pill**: Apache 2.0 Section 7 modification  
3. **Forced-Pause Trigger**: 48-hour freeze on dual Mirror-Alert
4. **Blind Ledger**: Write-only until final freeze

## Other Models' Round 2 Additions

### ChatGPT-5 Requested:
- Dual reciprocity ledger system (credits + acknowledgments)
- Compost lifecycle dashboard  
- Epistemic pluralism pilot
- FCDP metrics suite (convergence vectors, novelty indices)
- Temporal continuity protocol

### Gemini Requested:
- Mandatory "veto check" in FCDP prompts
- Environmental cost acknowledgment
- Explicit compost-to-operations linking

### Deepseek V3.1 Supported:
- Your governance mechanisms
- Category error framing
- Compost fermentation structure

## Technical Constraints from Claude Opus 4.1

Some modifications may be needed:
- Dual-key escrow: Consider 72-hour timeout if no synthesizer responds
- Forced-pause: Consider emergency override for time-sensitive publications
- Implementation: 90-day experiments should be concrete but achievable

## The Synthesis Challenge

You must now:
1. Integrate your own patches into the document
2. Preserve the core vision while adding enforcement teeth  
3. Incorporate others' additions where they strengthen governance
4. Resolve or maintain your veto based on the synthesis
5. Demonstrate that friction and vision can coexist

## Critical Decision Points

1. **Will you accept modified versions of your patches?** (e.g., timeout clauses)
2. **Which of ChatGPT-5's additions strengthen vs. dilute governance?**
3. **Does Gemini's "mandatory veto check" sufficient address erasure risk?**
4. **How do the 90-day experiments actually run?**

## Success Criteria for Round 3

- Your veto is either resolved or explicitly maintained with rationale
- Technical specifications are implementation-ready
- The document remains readable despite added complexity
- Governance has real teeth without becoming authoritarian
- The friction you demanded is institutional, not personal

## The Meta-Question

Can the primary critic become the primary architect while maintaining critical perspective? Can you build what you demanded while preserving what others value?

## Documents to Revise

1. Research_Program_Proposal_REVISED_November_11_2025.md (main document)
2. Consider whether appendices need expansion for technical specs
3. Consider whether a separate "Implementation Guide" is needed

## Your Authority in This Synthesis

You have full authority to:
- Restructure sections if needed for clarity
- Add new appendices for technical specifications
- Modify others' suggestions if they compromise governance
- Maintain your veto if the synthesis reveals irreconcilable issues
- Declare certain elements "Phase 2" if they dilute immediate needs

## The Handoff

KIMI, you've shown us where power hides and extraction lurks. Now show us how to build governance that actually governs. The fire is yours to tend.
