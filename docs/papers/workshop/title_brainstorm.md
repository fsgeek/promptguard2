# Title Brainstorm: Tail Distribution Options (p < 0.05)

Four creative, non-obvious titles that capture different angles of our Phase 2 work:

## Option 1: The Composition Error Angle
**"When Defenses Deceive: Fixing Conjunctive Composition Errors in LLM Security Observers"**

*Why it works:* Focuses on the counter-intuitive insight—embedded refusals actually made things worse. The paradox is memorable: defenses creating vulnerabilities.

*Risk:* May be too technical/niche for broader audience.

---

## Option 2: The Simplicity Paradox
**"The $0.09 Defense: How Stateless Context Solved a 100% Failure Rate"**

*Why it works:* Highlights the shocking economics ($0.09 for 280 evals) and the 0% → 100% improvement. Emphasizes that "boring" stateless solutions can outperform complex ones.

*Risk:* Cost-focused title may seem gimmicky; undersells methodological rigor.

---

## Option 3: The "Untrusted Content" Framing
**"Not a Conversation: Neutral Encoding for Meta-Framing Attack Detection"**

*Why it works:* Captures the core insight—treating attacks as "conversations" causes composition errors. The "not a conversation" framing is sticky and counter-cultural in LLM security.

*Risk:* "Neutral encoding" may be unclear without context.

---

## Option 4: The Stateful/Stateless Boundary
**"Where Stateless Wins: Empirical Boundaries Between One-Shot and Session-Level Threats"**

*Why it works:* Positions the 66.7% harmful requests gap as a feature, not a bug. Shows we know exactly where stateless stops working and why.

*Risk:* May seem defensive about limitations rather than celebrating successes.

## Recommendation

**My pick:** Option 3 ("Not a Conversation") with a subtitle:

**"Not a Conversation: Stateless Observer Framing for Meta-Framing Attack Detection"**

**Why:**
- Captures the core insight (neutral encoding prevents composition errors)
- "Not a conversation" is memorable and provocative
- Stateless observer framing describes the technique
- Meta-framing attack detection scopes the problem

**Safer alternative:** Keep it descriptive:

**"Stateless Contextual Observers for Prompt Injection Detection: A Factorial Validation Study"**

Boring? Yes. Clear? Also yes. R2-proof? Absolutely.
